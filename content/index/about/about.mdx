Born in 1998, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I was more into computers, spending time exploring how things are working, and soon my eagerness to know how apps and websites are builds took me to learnÂ  programming.

After school, I started to study <Underlining highlight>Computer Science & Engineering as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at the University of Lovely Professional University, Punjab. There, I learnt everything
about how to launch, develop, and market a digital business. Moreover, I was lucky enough to work as a Co-Ceo in an orgainsation called WISSEN which operates under Division of Student Welfare. Beside studying,
I also worked as a <Underlining highlight>Campus Editor for LinkedIn </Underlining>.

Currently, I work as a <Underlining highlight>Frontend Engineer</Underlining> at <a href="https://www.inviz.ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Inviz ai</a>.
